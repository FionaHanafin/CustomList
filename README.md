# CustomList
To understand the implementation of Custom Lists in Android.

By default, a List View control in android shows a set of text views to present some
content to the end-user. At times, we may want to customize the list view content
to present more information about the content being displayed. In such cases, we
have to implement the custom lists.

Develop and application which contains a custom list for a set of players.
Each list element has to show an image of the player, along with the Name and a
Nick Name. When the user clicks on a player custom list, the app has to navigate to
the another activity to show the profile of the player


1. A custom list activity which shows the players to the user to select from. [Custom Layout]
2. An activity which shows the brief profile of the player
